# Activity Summary for 5/6/2025

## 15:22:58
The log shows a series of changes related to setting up an environment for installing ILCSoft.  The `/Users/marherje/ruche_mount/load_enviroment.sh` script was modified twice within a short timeframe (15:01:43 and 15:03:35 on 5/6/2025).  These changes involved improving the verification of C++17 compatibility by adding a simple C++ program (`test.cpp`) to compile and check the `__cplusplus` macro.  The script consistently loads specific versions of GCC (11.2.0), CMake (3.28.3), and Python (3.9.10), all apparently using a module loading system.

The `readme_instalar_ilcsoft.md` file (modified at 15:09:22 on 5/6/2025) provides a step-by-step guide for installing ILCSoft using `ilcinstall`. It explicitly lists the required software versions (C++17, CMake 3.28.3, Python 3.6+), which are the same versions loaded in the `load_enviroment.sh` script. The README outlines the installation process, including cloning `ilcinstall`, selecting a configuration file, customizing the installation prefix (example uses `/gpfs/users/marquezj/ilcsoft/ILCSoft-02-01`), and finally sourcing an initialization script after installation.  The README and script show a strong correlation in the software versions and module loading procedures.
