# Activity Summary for 5/6/2025

## 15:22:58
The log shows a series of changes related to setting up an environment for installing ILCSoft.  The `/Users/marherje/ruche_mount/load_enviroment.sh` script was modified twice within a short timeframe (15:01:43 and 15:03:35 on 5/6/2025).  These changes involved improving the verification of C++17 compatibility by adding a simple C++ program (`test.cpp`) to compile and check the `__cplusplus` macro.  The script consistently loads specific versions of GCC (11.2.0), CMake (3.28.3), and Python (3.9.10), all apparently using a module loading system.

The `readme_instalar_ilcsoft.md` file (modified at 15:09:22 on 5/6/2025) provides a step-by-step guide for installing ILCSoft using `ilcinstall`. It explicitly lists the required software versions (C++17, CMake 3.28.3, Python 3.6+), which are the same versions loaded in the `load_enviroment.sh` script. The README outlines the installation process, including cloning `ilcinstall`, selecting a configuration file, customizing the installation prefix (example uses `/gpfs/users/marquezj/ilcsoft/ILCSoft-02-01`), and finally sourcing an initialization script after installation.  The README and script show a strong correlation in the software versions and module loading procedures.

The log shows modifications to `/Users/marherje/ruche_mount/ilcinstall/ilcsoft-install` and `/Users/marherje/ruche_mount/ilcinstall/releases/LATEST/release-versions.py`.

`/Users/marherje/ruche_mount/ilcinstall/releases/LATEST/release-versions.py` (May 6, 2025, 15:45:54): This file defines versions for various software packages used in the ilcsoft environment, including Geant4, CLHEP, ROOT, and many others specific to the ILC project.  The code specifies installation paths, compiler settings (C++17 is used), and paths to external tools like GCC, CMake, and Git via cvmfs and afs.  A significant portion is dedicated to defining specific versions for numerous packages.  The file also sets the ilcsoft release version to 'v02-02-03'.


`/Users/marherje/ruche_mount/ilcinstall/ilcsoft-install` (May 6, 2025, 16:05:37, 16:10:32, 16:17:06): This Python script handles the installation process.  It parses command-line options for previewing, installing, showing dependencies, and setting verbosity.  It reads a configuration file (specified as a command-line argument) to get specific installation parameters.  The script defines a dictionary `ilcsoft_afs_path` mapping various compiler/system architectures (e.g., `gcc82_64bit_centos7`) to their corresponding paths on the DESY AFS system.  Between the timestamps of 16:05:37 and 16:17:06,  the key change was the addition of `ilcsoft_afs_path['gcc112_64bit_centos7'] = os.path.expandvars('$HOME/ilcinstall/releases/v02-03')` in the last update, altering the path mapping for a specific architecture to a user's home directory.  The script uses this path information to determine the installation location.  The script's version is 'v01-17-07'.  The multiple updates to this file within a short timeframe suggest iterative debugging or adjustments to the installation logic.
